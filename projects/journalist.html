    <p>The Journalist, or redefinition of minimalist, is a smart, sophisticated WordPress theme designed for professional journalists.</p>

    <h4>Theme setup with WordPress</h4>

    <p>After you download the themes, you'll need to extract them to your <em>/wp-content/themes/</em> directory. Then log into WP and activate the theme from within your presentation panel.</p>

    <p>The themes are licensed under a GPL license. Basically, this means that you're free to do what you like with them as long as you redistribute them under the same license. I do have a small request: If you do use one of the themes, could you send <a href="http://lucianmarin.com/">a link back this way</a>? Of course, there is no obligation to do this other than professional courtesy but I would definitely appreciate the gesture. :-)</p>

    <h4>Support the project</h4>

    <p>The themes will always stay free, but donations are very much appreciated and will help continuing WordPress themes development &mdash; <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YSKP3VFTQS4YL">donate with PayPal</a>.</p>

    <p>The Journalist is used by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+journalist+lucian+e+marin">thousands of people</a> world wide from journalists to CEOs.</p>
