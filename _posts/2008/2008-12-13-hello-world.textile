Some days ago I said to me "hey, let's test Textpattern". And now, this is what I'm doing.

This article should be called "Bye Old World!, Hello New World!", because this is the *n*-th (where *n* can be multiplied by 2) time that I start a blog. "Logs" as I called it initialy, should be a replacement to different type of blogs that I had in the past: personal blog on lucmar.com, visual blog on lucianmarin.com, then csstransformer.com and recently, a microblog on <a href="http://twitter.com/lucianmarin" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>.

When it comes to having a personal blog, I'm always uncertain. The only exception is <a href="http://evno.ro/" class="follow">EVNO</a>, maybe because is a <a href="http://omenesc.ro/" class="follow">Romanian</a> magazine, written in my mother tongue.

??After all that being said, he is not sure what to do, to start fresh or to import some older -articles- posts???
