        Hello, I'm Lucian Marin. I have a background in electronics engineering and currently doing what I love, designing and building awesome products. I strongly think that design is all about making impossible <em>possible</em>. I dare to like meticulous design, modern typography, electronic music and everything in between.
    </p>
    <p>
        I designed and build <a href="/journalist/">The Journalist</a> &mdash; a very popular WordPress theme, I was interviewed by <a href="http://digerati.ro/lucian-marin" rel="nofollow">Digerati</a> &mdash; the Romanian version of <em>The Setup</em>, I was featured on the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/googles-new-favicon.html" rel="nofollow">official Google blog</a> for my work on their favicon, I have been part of team who wrote the <a href="/archive/i-wrote-a-book.html">Newscoop 3 Cookbook</a>, I have been interviewed and published in the <a href="/archive/an-iconic-book.html">Icon Handbook</a> about a peculiar project and probably did some other cool stuff that you may never hear about.
    </p>
    <h4>About the site</h4>
    <p>
        The site is created using the latest web innovations. It is statically generated with Jekyll and Saas. It is hosted by <a href="http://rohost.com/" rel="nofollow">Rohost</a> — probably the best hosting provider from Romania. For all typographic necessities I'm using <a href="http://dotcolon.net/font/vegur/" rel="nofollow">Vegur typeface</a>. The complete source code of the site is made available on <a href="https://github.com/lucianmarin/lm/">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some things on the site are written in 日本語 because I'm a fan of Japanese culture and art. I don't know the language, but I hope one day I get the chance to learn it.
    </p>
