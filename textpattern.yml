  Title: "Numbers and Half True Quotes"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "In this post I wanted to write about \"numbers\":http://www.flickr.com/photos/kalphegor/3216395914/ and their contributions to user interfaces, mostly on today top web applications. But after some thinking, it just didn't make sense. Numbers can be interpreted in different ways, depending on user perspective. \r\n\r\nFor example \"Kevin Rose\":http://kevinrose.com/ thinks that getting \"more followers\":http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/01/25/kevin-rose-10-ways-to-increase-your-twitter-followers/ on Twitter is better, but I tend to disagree. For me is more important to write a tweet that has more value in time, than it has to my followers. What I said is also available for Digg; not the number of diggs matters, but the importance of a news in time. For this, notice what Peter Schiff said about recession in \"2006\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRoVD0-5_5k or \"2007\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4d_dE2qgNU.\r\n\r\nThe question that I want to address to Digg, Google or any other company: how do we measure the relevance of a news story in time? And yes, it sounds like: how do we predict the future with today available tools and technology?\r\n\r\nbq. \"There's no present. There's only the immediate future and the recent past.\"\r\n&mdash; \"George Carlin\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin\r\n\r\nPresent is a complex state of mind. You can't separate it in two, three or one hundred, because it won't be right.\r\n\r\nbq. \"Content precedes design. Design in the absence of content is not design, it's decoration.\" \r\n&mdash; Jeffrey Zeldman on \"Twitter\":http://twitter.com/zeldman/status/804159148 \r\n\r\nDesign is also a structure or a form. And thinking this way around, it precedes content. It is actually the base that the content stands on; so without it, it won't be content.\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he wonders when his blog will hit -Digg- reddit's front page.??"

  Title: "Introducing Amatl"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "In today's world where millions of documents are electronic we need a format that is easy recognizable by most devices and operating systems that we use: Mac OS X, Windows, laptop, desktop, Linux, iPhone, eReaders, etc.\r\n\r\n??From the start, I want to say that the idea, concept, examples and eventually writing the specification, are all mine. So, go ahead, read the lines below and blame me for things that aren't the way they should be.??\r\n\r\n!images/9.png(Amatl)!\r\n\r\nThe name, Amatl, comes from a form of paper that was manufactured in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. There are \"more details about it\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amatl on Wikipedia, of course. My Amatl is based on HTML5 and CSS (2.1 now and 3.0 in the future), two standards that raised the bar with what we can do in terms of layout, embedding fonts, typography, grid and images or blocks positioning. Basically, Amatl is actually a file format that wants to display paper documents inside browsers without any additional tools or software. The format isn't intended at replacing Adobe's PDF format or Microsoft's XPS; it should be used as a complementary format, open and supported by the entire industry. The closest resembles to it can be \"EPUB format\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB but they are two completely different concepts. \r\n\r\nh4. Compatibility\r\n\r\nThe good part about this format is that it can be recognizable by old browsers too, I name Firefox 2 and IE7 here. It's just HTML after all, right?\r\n\r\nh4. Differences\r\n\r\nThere will be no differences when it comes to HTML5 syntax, maintaining the current specification is very important. Still, I recommend not using _meta_ attributes because they will be present in a CSS metadata header.\r\n\r\nThe most important differences to CSS is introduction of a DPI value and a CSS metadata header. It will be used to write documents at a higher DPI than 96, which is the standard to all web pages on Internet today.\r\n\r\nh4. Structure\r\n\r\nThe Amatl document files should be packed in a ZIP container, having .am extension (like Document1.am) for offline usage and not only. Browser support will be needed for reading HTML files packed inside a ZIP.  It can also be served directly from a server with the following structure:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nindex.html\r\npage-2.html\r\npage-3.html\r\n|-- styles\r\n   |-- screen.css\r\n   |-- print.css\r\n|-- fonts         /* embeddable fonts should be placed here */ \r\n|-- languages     /* support for multi languages documents */\r\n   |-- index-en-us.html\r\n   |-- index-en-gb.html\r\n   |-- index-ro-ro.html\r\n|-- images\r\n|-- videos\r\n|-- audios\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nh4. Writing, printing and scaling the documents\r\n\r\nIt should be very easy to write an Amatl document, like writing a blog post with basic HTML tags: _p_, _a_, _strong_, etc. This is because the HTML5 structure of the format is very easy. You can view the source of this example: \"Document 1\":http://lucianmarin.com/amatl/examples/doc1/. Printing documents can use a _print.css_ file or the browser should interpret the _screen.css_ (remove styles for body and article tags) and print the pages exactly like they are displayed on the screen.\r\n\r\nAs I said before, Amatl will supports writing HTML5 with custom DPI through CSS. You can understand how this works by viewing the \"Warp\":http://lucianmarin.com/amatl/examples/warp/ example from Firefox (or any other browser that supports zooming) at minimum zoom. If browsers will adopt this format, you can view higher quality web documents right in your browser, including higher DPI images and graphics and you can print them right away without needing any other software.\r\n\r\nAmatl can also use a single HTML file, that embeds CSS, fonts and images and separates pages accordingly. You can see this in the \"Document 2\":http://lucianmarin.com/amatl/examples/doc2/ example. This can be dropped from the specifications since I prefer a more standard structure for the format.  \r\n\r\nh4. License\r\n\r\nThe format should and will be open since it's based on open technologies, but it will require a commercial license for software products or web applications for writing, managing or printing the documents. More about this in the future and don't forget there is \"an Amatl page\":http://lucianmarin.com/amatl/ dedicated for this very project."

  Title: "Geronimo!"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I know I didn't write for awhile now; well I have been busy with (real) life and other stuff. Yesterday, I received Geronimo!'s latest EP, \"A Different Kind of Greatness\" from Ben Grigg.\r\n\r\n!images/6.jpg!\r\n\r\nThe album has five tracks: Your New Shadow, Approaching the Skyline, Do the Driving, Black Gate City and Ender. Even if \"Aproaching the Skyline\" sounds amazing, my favorite song is \"Ender\", it fits with my current mood. I should add that they play rock with some indie influences.\r\n\r\nTwo interesting facts about the band is that they don't have a bass player and they make and design their own merchandise.\r\n\r\nGo listen: \"myspace.com/thegeronimoband\":http://myspace.com/thegeronimoband\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he agrees with the guys that there is a special place in -heaven- hell for the creator of auto tune.??"

  Title: "I Love You"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I wanted to make a stop motion movie, but ended up with over 2 minutes of footage filmed on May 11, 2007. Last Sunday I discovered it on a tape. Thinking that I can do something with it, I speed it up 4 times and correct the colors in iMovie '09. All the zooming/blurring effects that you'll see are made with camera itself.

  Title: "The UI Glitch Apple Ignores"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "The problem here is that the arrow doesn't point the center of the icon highlighted on Dock. It only appears on Exposé mode of the Dock, when you click and hold an icon in the Dock. The UI glitch was introduced in 10.6.5 update of Snow Leopard and I reported it on \"my Twitter account\":http://twitter.com/lucianmarin/status/6891287198310401 in November last year.\r\n\r\n!images/21.jpg(Dock Exposé Glitch)!\r\n\r\nAfter 10.6.6 update of Mac OS X, I looked to see if this was fixed, but for my surprise, it wasn't. How come a company that emphasis the design of its products as a feature, doesn't care for small details like this? I looked to see if this bug was reported on any Apple related blog and I didn't find any related stories. How come nobody noticed it and report it to Apple?\r\n\r\nI thought \"Mr. Gruber\":http://daringfireball.net/ will be the first person to report this, but lately he's more preoccupied with what Google or Microsoft does. Also, I wonder if this bug will still be present on the next version of Mac OS X named \"Lion\":http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/."

  Title: "Do You Believe in God?"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "Yesterday evening I went to see \"Angels & Demons\":http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/angelsdemons/ and I didn't even sleep since then; coming to write this post in the morning. It's 5:44 AM and it's a Wednesday. My thoughts are clear like water, if water can be used as a measure of clarity.\r\n\r\nMy answer to my own question is \"No\". Let me explain myself. My mind can't understand the term of God. It just can't, the term is too big. I can't draw something on paper when I'm thinking about God. I can't feel his presence when I'm praying, and I'm pretty sure that even an atheist did pray at least once in his lifetime.\r\n\r\nBut, I sense an energy when I pick a rock, I hear something profound when I'm in a forest, I feel a vibration when I'm talking to someone else and I know you're feeling the same. Sometimes it isn't a good vibration/energy, but it is there. What is \"this thing\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy that makes all other things connect and the way they are? Can I call it God and be done with it? I think I don't have other choice for the moment, but one day I hope I will have the chance to find out what it is.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I'm thinking of is Universe. I believe is finite, not only in space, but also in time; and it's not expanding. Actually, this was my first existential question at age of four and it sounded like: \"What's beyond Universe?\" (Sorry, Mom). I had an answer right away: \"It's must be finite, it has a margin and beyond it is something black, incomprehensible\". In 9th grade I found a way to demonstrate myself that it was indeed finite; that was when I learned about \"mathematical induction\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction. Probably beyond Universe is \"antimatter\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter, but who knows exactly...\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he wants to -sleep- dream on. It's 6:44 AM. Over.??"

  Title: "Disconnected"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I no longer use Twitter. It seems that I won't \"announce earthquakes\":http://www.flickr.com/photos/kalphegor/3473591981/ when they'll happen again. I removed all the contacts from Flickr, I wanted to keep some, but I didn't want to \"discriminate\":http://www.flickr.com/photos/kalphegor/3624322513/. I will keep using their service. I did the same for the Facebook and LinkedIn profiles, connections are more and more worthless online. I want to consume web and participate in conversations in a different way, in a way that doesn't put me in center of action (attention) or at least I shouldn't be aware of that. Well, that's because I'm not that kind of person.\r\n\r\nI'm a person that cares about every little detail, pixel you might say, and when the \"effect of abundance\":http://www.uxmag.com/strategy/273/abundance-and-ux makes its appearance, you want to go back to basics for new start. The problem with technology and with web applications is that they are changing too fast. Yesterday you singed up for a service that you enjoyed and tomorrow that thing is completely different. Why doesn't anybody cares about when I joined their web application (software) and provide me the very same experience? I'll do like that. For example if Textpattern will change the user experience in the next version I won't make the switch, because for me usability is what I'm getting used to.\r\n\r\nh4. The First Idea\r\n\r\nYou now may ask: how the heck this guy sees the future of online contacts? Well, a while ago I had a very interesting idea and it sounded like: \"@lucianmarin\":http://twitter.com/lucianmarin/status/1616912061 needs (or wants to make) a site that bookmarks people and their online accounts (Flickr, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) including latest activity. What I wanted to say is that we need a piece of software that facilitates not only the new way of communication (you fill a profile and I subscribe to it) nor the old way (I fill a profile for you in my address book), but actually a mutual connection where both you and me fill a \"profile\". I'm calling this people bookmarking.\r\n\r\n\"HP\":http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8090427.stm is doing the same old thing one more time with its mobile social network. My idea works different, let's say you are Leo Laporte and you just spoke with Mike Arrington. After that you can fill in his profile a comment line \"What a jerk, I will never spoke with him again\" (it was for \"real\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsV-lgnAjps&fmt=18). Mike Arrington can check what others said about him and founds the line. The beautiful part about this is that Leo Laporte will keep this in his web application data, and Mike will see it only when they are linked together. So basically, no link, no fun and no public embarrassment for neither of them.\r\n\r\nh4. The Second Idea\r\n\r\nOh man, this should be much more fun. I bet everyone knows about blogroll, that's what makes your blog a little bit more \"social\". Since the beginning of \"EVNO\":http://evno.ro/ authors where listed different, they had a picture, their name and a status. That's pretty static, you might say. But what if this was interactive? Like a distributed social network where everyone can hook up, if they have a site (blog) or they are already on a social network.\r\n\r\n!images/7.png(Social Roll)!\r\n\r\nBy the way, I got a new phone, it's a dumb phone, but it has 1GB internal memory with microSD option and a very nice music player. I liked Opera Mini on Sony Ericsson K8OOi (this 3 years old phone has a better camera than the new iPhone 3GS; I had to say it); and I hope it will stay the same beautiful piece of software in the future.\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he admits that this is a protest against social media -stupidity- abundance.??"

  Body: "Over the last year or so, I started collecting \"album covers\":https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/63362/1/Covers?h=eb60c0 and squaring each one for better use in media players like iTunes. The purpose of all this was to build my first web app using Django.\r\n\r\nBut since always dreams don't manage to become reality, I decided to make \"this small collection\":https://www.dropbox.com/gallery/63362/1/Covers?h=eb60c0 public. There are over 200 covers right now and sorted by the artist name. I have one small request, if you like Dropbox please use \"this link\":https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTYzMzYyOQ to register for an account; it gives both of us 250 MB extra space.\r\n\r\n!images/8.jpg(Square Covers)!\r\n\r\nMy favourite covers, and albums, are Sneaky Sound System's—an Australian & electronic band—because of clever use of patterns and typography.\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he will keep on listening \"Dirge\" by -life- Death in Vegas.??"

  Title: "The New Design"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "For months I tried to design a new interface for \"my website\":http://www.behance.net/gallery/Blog-Designs/550101. There have been lots of ideas and lots of thoughts. I wanted the old design to became a classic—maybe it did, maybe not—but then I changed my mind since I'm a man that likes to create new things and play with new ideas. One idea I experimented with \"the new layout\":http://www.flickr.com/photos/kalphegor/4835474874/ is the vertical grid, every text line is vertically aligned between content and sidebar areas.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get rid of the static pages, it was hard to update those. I wanted the new site to be lighting fast, so there are no images for the layout, all details are made in CSS and there's no JavaScript at all. Pictograms that you see here and there are made in CSS too. I will release these icons for public use in a package called \"Peculiar\":http://lucianmarin.com/peculiar/.\r\n\r\nYou might noticed that there isn't a logo anywhere. That's because I have new ideas about how a new logo should look like.\r\n\r\n!images/11.png(New logo design process)!\r\n\r\nComments are disabled because they are the only thing that makes a journal to be a blog. I don't want a blog, I want a journal of my online activities. I may also want feedback, but I think a short and interesting e-mail will do it better—of course I will answer to any of them.\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he wishes he was born in a country where -Romanian- English was the official language.??"

  Title: "Rank Me Up"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "Please, don't. At least not on social networks like Twitter. Some days ago Eric Schmidt had an interview which is published on \"ReadWriteWeb\":http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_web_in_five_years.php and it's about what web will look like in five years. One of his questions was \"We can index real-time info now - but how do we rank it?\".\r\n\r\nGoogle approach to the web is to rank everything. But on Twitter we all are equal to each other, we have the same number of characters to write a message (140, remember?), the number of followers doesn't matter, time when you joined Twitter is not important, lists or favourites won't help either. So basically we don't need a rank system on Twitter.\r\n\r\n\"Dave Winer\":http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/10/28/howToRankRealtimeSearch.html votes for ranking on his blog. But, what we really need is an exclusion system. First, we need to exclude spam. Then exclude retweets and reposition the original tweet instead of last retweet with the number of retweets for a possible importance level. Favourites could also matter in ranking tweets up, but again, keeping them sorted by dated is more important.\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he thinks that will be -impossible- possible to rank real time information, but it won't be that clever.??"

  Title: "A Peculiar Feeling of Restlessness"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I always forget there are more than a hundred of people reading this particular blog and even more people knowing this site because of \"The Journalist\":http://lucianmarin.com/page/themes/ — a theme created for WordPress years ago and popular even in this day and age of internet. Knowing there are people out there interested in what I do, makes me feel I want to write here. The problem with blogging (or any other activity) is that it brings back that peculiar feeling of restlessness. I'm a restless person myself, and young, but I can't stand the feeling of being restless. It makes me ignore important things I want to do, create, design, achieve, believe and so on until I don't believe in anything anymore. It's a virtuous circle followed by a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nLast month I started working on a different kind of project, namely \"Peculiar\":http://lucianmarin.com/peculiar/. An icon package that is made only in CSS with the purpose to help designers create user interfaces for the web without use of software programs and to help developers achieve as few HTTP requests as possible, thus speeding up web applications. This a challenge for me and for anyone interested in the future of user interfaces for the web, to make use of CSS as intelligently as possible — creating designs in Adobe Photoshop, slicing images and putting them as backgrounds in CSS doesn't make \"a lot of sense anymore\":http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/a-real-web-design-application/.\r\n\r\n!images/12.png(Peculiar)!\r\n\r\nI want to say thank you to a couple of blogs for spreading the news about the development of this peculiar project. In no particular order, here they are: \"Think Vitamin\":http://thinkvitamin.com/design/pure-css-icons-pure-madness/, \"Echo Enduring\":http://blog.echoenduring.com/2010/08/14/are-we-taking-css-too-far/, \"Faruk Ateş\":http://farukat.es/journal/2010/08/469-pure-css-icons-make-madness-stop, \"Matthias Schütz\":http://matthiasschuetz.com/peculiar-icon-package-mit-css-symbolen and those Chinese blogs. I also want to thank to the man that bought the first license for Peculiar.\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he wants to change things that we accustomed to for the -worst- better.??"

Yes, I started writing a new draft for my birthday which, guess what, was also postponed. Now let me explain. \"Great Union Day\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Union_Day is the national holiday of Romania and it's celebrated on December 1st. \"My birthday\":http://www.flickr.com/photos/kalphegor/5207162021/ was five days before this event, enough time to lose track of the things I have to do and care about."

  Title: "Everybody's Fault"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "What should I write about? The fact that life is stupid or the fact the fact that we make it stupid. Then we come to wonder how did we end up like this.\r\n\r\nOne particular thing that itches me every time I hear it is the expression \"nobody's fault\". Somebody dies, somebody is sick, somebody close to you is having a problem, somehow you're staying in the way of someone trying to solve their problems, yet you don't take any blame. I can go on and list all the things that you can improve in your life or in the life of the people close to you. But who am I? I'm just somebody that takes the blame.\r\n\r\nWorld would be a better place if everyone will just care. Take the blame, take the responsibility, make your life meaningful. Fight for something, lose something, win nothing or more than you imagine — a better life.\r\n\r\nA few guys with PhDs in various fields will contradict me saying that I'm wrong because they're the smart-asses who can see the truth. Who the fuck am I? Just another web designer. Probably not even a good designer, just web «something».\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he agrees that some people are heartbroken, others are just broken.??"

  Title: "Stop Innovating!"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "We should strive for invention (discovery), not for innovation (something new). Why? Because a great idea is always better than a new idea. Greatness is not a given, it can only be achieved.\r\n\r\nh4. Start inventing\r\n\r\nGo outside, take a walk in the park and start using your mind to concept things that are 50% imagination and 50% reality. Every great idea started this way. You should focus on imagining things until they meet reality, at that point everything you thought about can be made possible. For real.\r\n\r\nh4. Make it work\r\n\r\nThe hardest part is to make things work. It's not impossible. Start at the core of your idea, try to fix the problems that are basic and easy solvable. Build on that. Try to find the next piece of the puzzle that is related to the core. Somehow things will work even you don't believe they will. It happened to me, it happened to others, it can happen to you.\r\n\r\nAlbert Einstein did it, Max Planck did it before him, why can't you? They were only people, not geniuses, just _people_."

  Title: "Let's Get Frisky"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I am a very complicated man, I change my mind every now and then. A few months ago I bought a new domain: \"friskr.com\":http://friskr.com/. The idea was to create a brand new web application where people can upload only black and white photography. The plan was to also build an iPhone app that will let you create dramatic grey scaled photos.\r\n\r\nI was pretty sure I can build the entire app myself. I could learn to develop the app with Django and a NoSQL database. I also thought I could deploy the newly created app on an old PC which will run an Ubuntu server. But all this time I got the feeling that this will never happen. Instead, I tried to run a blog where I post interesting black and white photographs just to promote my idea.\r\n\r\nThis week I changed my mind. I'm thinking the name \"Friskr\":http://friskr.com/ works better for a modern magazine. What do you think?"

  Title: "A Dash in Space-Time Continuum"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "Back in 2009 I wanted to make a change in the way I use social networks. I simply \"disconnect from everything\":http://lucianmarin.com/archive/disconnected. It was a good thing to do because I managed to spare myself some time, otherwise it could be wasted on stalking pretty girls on Facebook. I'm joking, of course. No, I probably didn't joke, but I'm sure you'll get the idea.\r\n\r\nIt comes a time when a social site reach its maximum attention span and everybody tends to ignore why they came there in the first place. The place becomes unwanted for people that actually cared for what the social sites stood in the beginning. \r\n\r\nh4. A little bit of history\r\n\r\nBefore Twitter, Flickr was the only social network I needed. I was using it for everything: designs, posters, mock-ups, photographs, sets, experiments, even \"embarrassing updates\":http://www.flickr.com/photos/kalphegor from time to time. Then Facebook came along and promised to be the best at it. After some time I was disappointed by two facts: people joined Facebook because \"it was cool\":http://www.hunterwalk.com/2012/01/sorry-mike-facebook-could-reboot-and.html, not because they wanted to be part of a community. Second reason was that Flickr was acquired by Yahoo! — they didn't get the fact that Flickr was a network of small communities that could interact between each others.\r\n\r\nNowadays we have another monster in the house which is called Google Plus. I was using it for a few months. It was really cool and addictive in the beginning because I could create myself some small communities called \"circles\" and interact nicely with each of them. But suddenly people are joining Google Plus in masses and all those small communities are now dispersed and they will increase to sparse to the point when nobody will give a crap anymore.\r\n\r\nh4. Dash and moving forward\r\n\r\nDash comes to cover a need for people that are interested on \"my online activities\":http://lucianmarin.com/dash/. There is a girl that was trying to be up-to-date with everything I did on the web. I created the \"dashboard\" to make her life easier. Strangely, it makes my life easier too. Because now I'm aware of what services I really need, the usage on various social networks and the openness of others.\r\n\r\nRegarding the usage, I noticed that I no longer need Tumblr to showcase photos I take because its functionality was replaced altogether by Instagram. Also noticed that Flickr back in its glory days is now replaced by Dribbble, Instagram and Twitter.\r\n\r\nRegarding the openness, I would have liked to include a feed of my favorites on SoundCloud. But they didn't provide this basic feature. Instead you have to create a developer account, receive a token, understand the API and then get a XML of those bloody favorite tracks. This is not how the future should look like. The \"big guys\" of the industry should be the first to promote tools like RSS feeds for their users. Only a _true_ open social network has a future, the others will cease to exist at some point."

  Title: "Berlin Alexanderplatz"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "After my trip in Germany was over, I made myself a present: a compact camera, a Nikon P300. Then, by taking a picture in low light of some books, I noticed that in our small library there’s a special book. This book is called \"Berlin Alexanderplatz\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Alexanderplatz and was written by Alfred Döblin. After this coincidence occurred, I decided that Berlin deserves an article in my journal. Why? Because Alexanderplatz is one of the nicest places in Berlin and before I left the city, I went back to Charlie Checkpoint, somewhere near Alexanderplatz to buy some souvenirs.\r\n\r\n!images/24.jpg(Books Showing Berlin Alexanderplatz)!\r\n\r\nBerlin is called the City of Stones and the City of Smoke by Jason Lutes in two of his comic books. I will use the same names to describe the Berlin I saw and I liked and somehow, disliked.\r\n\r\nh4. The City of Stones\r\n\r\nThis is the bright face of Berlin, the one that can make you think that this big city can change your life once and for all. The truth is that it can change your perspective of seeing things.\r\n\r\nFrom the impressive Fernsehturm, the TV tower, down to architecture of each church and cathedral, Berlin has lots of things to offer to its visitors. There are lots of museums, but I didn’t have the chance to visit them because of the short time I stayed in the city. All those museums looked great from outside; I still wonder what amazing things they were hiding inside. I can go on and describe everything I saw, but that wouldn’t be much fun.\r\n\r\nh4. The City of Smoke\r\n\r\nWhat I didn’t like about Berlin is maybe the american influence. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against americans, I’m against their influence in some parts of the world. What I wanted to see in Berlin was people coming from multiple parts of the world and get along with each other. But, I didn’t like the fact that all those people were embracing the american culture, instead of joining the german culture which in fact has more to offer that the other one.\r\n\r\nWalking down the streets of Berlin I was amazed to notice muslims, jews, black people and going to Alexanderplatz there was very few people speaking German. I was listening to people speaking French, Italian, Spanish and lots of people speaking English. I was thinking… how many Romanians are living in Berlin?\r\n\r\n!images/25.jpg(Pictures of Berlin)!\r\n\r\nI also took some pictures along the way, which are in fact \"two collections\":http://picplz.com/user/lucianmarin/collections/ posted on PicPlz: Berlin and German Countryside. For those pictures I used just a cellphone, a Sony Ericsson K800i — I think I pushed it to its limits. That’s the reason why I wanted to buy myself a real camera when I went back home."

  Title: "I Wrote a Book"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "Sourcefabric organized a book sprint near Berlin, where an international team wrote a book in just five days. The book is actually a manual for getting started creating templates and using \"Newscoop\":http://www.sourcefabric.org/en/products/newscoop_overview/ at its full power. Newscoop is a content management system (CMS) specialized for news sites, magazines and mass media publications. Of course, my theme \"The Journalist\" is already ported to this new CMS.\r\n\r\nh4. The Book\r\n\r\nNewscoop 3 Cookbook can already be order from \"Lulu\":http://www.lulu.com/browse/search.php?fSearch=newscoop and will be available for free on \"FLOSS Manuals\":http://en.flossmanuals.net/. I wrote a full section describing the best practices for designing websites. Here I talked about templates grids, golden ratio, typography, article and comments design for Newscoop. I also wrote a few other sections regarding Facebook, HTML 5 and best practices for SEO.\r\n\r\n!images/22.jpg(SoundCloud Workflow Diagrams)!\r\n\r\nI designed all the diagrams used in the book. I used a black and white style on a math paper. I tried to simply and clarify every step showed on each diagram. It's not an easy process as it seems. You have to conceptualize the whole process and then create each step displayed in the diagram. Of course, the team helped me where I got stucked and in the end, I manage to finished them all.\r\n\r\nh4.  The Team and the place\r\n\r\n!images/23.jpg(The Cookbook Team)!\r\n\r\nEach member from the team was from a different country. New Zeeland, USA, Romania, Belarus, Serbia, Columbia and Germany were the countries that we originate from. We stayed at \"Schloss Neuhausen\":http://www.schloss-neuhausen.de/ where a few black cats entertained us and blossoming trees put some light on our faces. I'm not sure if it's important, but I got the biggest room and I enjoyed each moment spent here."

  Title: "Standby: Lights, Camera, Action!"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I think I did the same mistake, again. Rewind. It all started back in 2006 when for no reason I wanted a cell phone with a good camera, so I can always have it with me. I got a Sony Ericsson K800i which was the first phone branded Cyber-shot, the leading compact camera brand from Sony. It was quite annoying at first for others to see my crappy photos taken with a cell phone on \"Flickr\":http://www.flickr.com/photos/kalphegor. Everything got better over time, I started to get that desire that drives you to get the perfect shot, no matter the camera,  lens or lighting. In the end, I think I got a few decent shots for a phone. The need for a real camera was driving me crazy for a few years. Finally, I gave up after Nikon announced its last P-series cameras. The Coolpix P300 was looking so good that I couldn't help myself not buy it.\r\n\r\nActually, I think it all started back in 2004 when I got a Sony Handycam, a consumer friendly camcoder with a really small sensor. I will always hate that small resolution clips. The same thing happen with the K800i and I promised myself not to get a camera with a small sensor ever again, but I did, because good cameras are for rich persons. Who in this world has money for a Leica X1, FujiFilm FinePix X100 or anything full-frame from Canon or Nikon? I know that quality comes with a price, but I think the price is too high. C'mon, it's 2011, the glass is still made of SiO₂ and the sensor technology didn't change much in over a decade — I know this because I study it in college. Why the prices didn't go down? Is it all about keeping a brand alive even it's dead in the water? Or do these brands think photographers are stupid enough to pay a high price for a brand new camera?\r\n\r\nMy new camera is like my old camera, it's light, black and has that small sensor that makes pictures dirty when you need them clean and sharp. Nikon Expeed 2 doesn't exceed my expectations at all. The water looks like plastic, people faces are so smooth you can't see the pores even if you take a macro shot. I really hope for a new firmware to disable some of these insane noise reductions features. The 1080p recording feature of the camera is actually great and you can even record directly in an high contrast black and white mode.\r\n\r\nI started \"a new photoblog on Tumblr\":http://lucianmarin.tumblr.com/ to show case the pictures I take from time to time. I will try to keep my journal free of photos so I won't disturb my readers with dirty pixels when all they want to do is to read my thoughts. Some people where hoping for a detailed review of Nikon Coolpix P300, but \"DPreview\":http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikonp300/ already took care of that for me. People are starting to follow me on Tumblr, I hope you do to, if you have an account there."

  Title: "Theory of Everything"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "Walking trough Herăstrău Park in Bucharest, I heard foreigners talking about similarities between Central Park from New York and this beautiful park from Romania. From what I saw in the american movies, I couldn't think of any similar things at that moment, but looking it up on Wikipedia, I can see what they where talking about.\r\n\r\nThe above part has nothing to do with what I was thinking. Thinking there was nothing to think about, I was actually starting to think about \"actions\". Actions are to me more important than objects (form of matter) because they determine not only the starting form, but more importantly the final form of something (it could be anything). If there's posible to define a set of rules of how to measure actions, how are they propagated in time and space, then I can think there's possible to define a basic theory of everything (life forms, universe itself, a star, entropy, etc.). My \"actions\" are very similar of Einstein's moving bodies, but they can refer to forces too (e.g. G).\r\n\r\nMy theory of everything is in a very incipient form where I observed only the characteristics of these actions. Basically, every action has a constrain variable (variable of constrain), a constant of freedom and it usually hits a roadblock.\r\n\r\nTheory of everything:\r\n- constrain variables\r\n- constant of freedom\r\n- roadblocks\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  Title: "A Future That Doesn't Exist"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I am starting to see a lot of motivational and futuristic videos lately. They promote technology as the core of advancing society and it almost made me cry to see how untrue this is. Just watch Networked Society's \"On the Brink\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7cuatm_bqw or Microsoft's \"Productivity Future Vision\":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6cNdhOKwi0 then wait a minute and think about. Is this what we really want from our future?\r\n\r\nThis future everyone talks about doesn't really exist and it will never will. It's just our imagination wanting to do more with less possible resources and more technology. But nothing changes, society is and will be the same, no matter how connected or educated we are, no matter how advanced technology will be in the future. Modern society won't advance by playing World of Warcraft or by learning online Artificial Intelligence courses from Stanford, it needs an external threat that will bring us together, it needs something called \"love\" and it needs power to change.\r\n\r\nSeeing technology as a threat is not the way – technology, the Internet, connected devices are just tools, tools that were here for thousands of years. When humanity discovered fire, it didn't know what to do with it. That's what technology is today, a sparkle for the future — a future were we need to learn to use intelligent machines for our own good. A future were we give up on wars, were we give up on being divided by cultures and traditions, a future totally different from what we imagine today."

  Title: "Such Great Heights"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "!images/26.jpg(Such Great Hights)!\r\n\r\nToday, air planes won’t fall from the sky. Today is \"Romania's National Day\":http://instagr.am/p/Ww8U5/. The picture was taken at the parade. The push of a button makes you realize that you can save the joy, the excitement, the dreams of all people that are watching the event. Then you go home and feel lonely, insignificant, like nothing ever happen. The only thing you got is the moment you saved, the picture that lives in your mind, a memory that fades away slowly.\r\n\r\nThere is a saying: you can't see the sky from the trees. What I'm gonna say is that without trees, there will be no sky. Without people, there will be no heights, no expectations from you. You have to climb on the back of other people to reach those heights — there is no other way around."

  Title: "The Choice Is Yours"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "Can you choose what to do? I bet you do. We live in a world where the only way forward is to make choices. Letting others make the choices for us is a step backward.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that we are afraid of making wrong choices. It's not a bad thing to always be right, but in the long run it can be a burden and it won't get you too far. Making wrong choices from now and then can relax your thought, freeing your mind like they say in the Matrix. Can you remember that scene from the movie when Neo tries to jump from one building to another? He focuses on doing everything right and as expected, he fails harder.\r\n\r\nBe stressed about the right choices you already made and don't be worried that you gonna make some wrong ones too. The right choices are the ones that get you far, bring you satisfactions and you will almost die for to make it through. The wrong choices are there to keep you focused on what is important. I won't tell you what is important because in the end, I'm not you.\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he made the -right- wrong choice to write this entire article on his iPhone using Simplenote app.??"

  Title: "An Iconic Book"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "Back in October last year I received an email from \"Jon Hicks\":http://hicksdesign.co.uk/ asking me about the \"Peculiar\":http://lucianmarin.com/peculiar/ icon project. It was a surreal moment for me, since one of my favorite designers was asking me about a project of mine.\r\n\r\nAfter exchanging one or two emails, I understood that he was actually writing a book about iconography. Later the book was finished under the name \"the Icon Handbook\":http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/the-icon-handbook and included Peculiar as a reference project for CSS icons. I was pretty anxious waiting for the book to be available for purchase.\r\n\r\n!images/27.jpg(Peculiar inside the Icon Handbook)!\r\n\r\nI think I finally made my father proud. He was working more than 30 years with \"movable type\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movable_type and quite liked the icons from the handbook. He even ask me to translate the interview with me.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure any designer will want to have this book on his desk. I, for one, I'm honored to be included in it."

  Title: "Write More, Do More"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "A few years ago when I begun writing on a Romanian blog I got people telling me to write more. I perfectly understood _why_, but I never understood _when_ as in how much. This got me thinking lately.\r\n\r\nHere, on lucianmarin.com I decided that I should write an article once a month and no more because it will let people thinking that I don't have better things to do. But I _do_.\r\n\r\nMy site didn't become popular because of my writings, instead one of my WordPress theme was an unexpected success. It created a vortex effect where everything else I created got sucked in no matter what I did. Design, photography, web development, articles — almost everything became second or nowhere to be seen. Think of Apple after iPod was introduced, they became something else entirely and people seen them differently.\r\n\r\nThis is not me, I always said to myself. I can do more, much more. I never settled on being the WordPress guy. So, at this point in time I will start to let people know that I'm not what they see, I'm what I want them to see. Writing more is probably just the beginning."

  Title: "Juicy Fruits in the Mix"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I know, I know… I shouldn't have started this article with such a catchy title. I should have gone with \"Fruit Madness\", \"This is Sparta, Fruit\" or maybe \"Return of the Fruit\". But making juice is like listening to the summer hit. I don't know what this summer hit is, but now I know how to make juice.\r\n\r\nBack in February, I was watching a movie where one guy loved his blender more than anything. That was weird and I remember it! And then comes my love for juice, any juice, every juice, only juice. Mixing those two ideas was a natural way to start an addiction.\r\n\r\nI'm a rookie when it comes to anything that involves kitchen. Things get better over time, I have to admit this too. My first attempt at making juice was a complete disaster. Two grapefruits  and a bit of cold water were smashed by the blender. The result was something closer to the worst lemonade you can buy from the cheapest restaurant than juice.\r\n\r\nAfter more than a month of trial and failure, it came to this:\r\n\r\n!images/28.jpg(Fruits blending machine)!\r\n\r\nMy recipe varies by the ingredients that I have. Although the basics are the same. So, here's a list of the things I recommend:\r\n\r\n* Juicy grapefruits, the big red ones are great.\r\n* Any other fruits that you like.\r\n* All the fruits have to be peeled. Also, check for seeds.\r\n* Honey, but don't use much. You can add sugar if you want it sweeter.\r\n* Cold mineral water with or without lemon. Schweppes can be a life savior in this case.\r\n\r\nRegarding the blender, any cheap blender from \"Amazon\":http://amzn.to/PiG6cH will do the trick. It's more of a personal taste than anything. I don't recommend juicy extractors. You lose more than 50% of the content of the fruit by using them, even on citrus fruits."

  Title: "Character Counter in Textpattern"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "The recent \"announcement\":https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api by Twitter made me sad. I talked about the issues with social networks in _A Dash in Space-Time Continuum_ and _Disconnected_, so I'm not gonna discuss it again.\r\n\r\nAnyway, two days before the announcement I launched \"my own private column\":http://lucianmarin.com/links/ featuring links and news that I find interesting. It's a twitterrific-delicous-pinboarding kind of thing. Of course, it even comes with a RSS feed and character counter. How did I do it? The main ingredients were: Textpattern, FeedBurner, jQuery and charCount.js plugin.\r\n\r\nI used FeedBurner to enhance the feed provided by Textpattern. The links page was set to be the default admin tab. The character counter was added because I need to keep myself limited, not to pollute the air traffic on the interwebs. For everything else, I can always write an article.\r\n\r\nh4. Back on the subject\r\n\r\nIt's pretty easy to add charCount.js from \"CSS Globe\":http://cssglobe.com/jquery-plugin-simplest-twitterlike-dynamic-character-count-for-textareas/ since TextPattern comes by default with jQuery. All you have to do is to edit _txplib_head.php_ from _/textpattern/lib/_. The you have to add the code below after jQuery declaration:\r\n\r\nbc. <!-- character count -->\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"charCount.js\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n	$(document).ready(function(){	\r\n		$(\"#link-description\").charCount();\r\n	});\r\n</script>\r\n<style type=\"text/css\">\r\n.counter { position: absolute; }\r\n.counter.warning { color: #e40; }\r\n</style>\r\n<!-- count the end too -->\r\n\r\nMake sure you backup the original _txplib_head.php_ before you do this and upload charCount.js where jquery.js file is located. The same thing can be applied to the textarea for article editing, all you have to do is to add the right ID in the code above."

  Title: "Personal App.net Client"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "Most of us don't want to use our credit cards to pay online, some of us just can't, others prefer PayPal, some think that web should just be free. App.net charges up front if you want use their web application. These two premises don't add up.\r\n\r\nThanks to App.net guys there's a third option. You can still use the web app without creating an account. This is good for people that already have Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr accounts and don't need yet another account to manage on a day by day basis.\r\n\r\nThe best part about App.net is that they provide a RSS feed for everyone's account. You can grab the RSS from \"people (Marco Arment)\":https://alpha.app.net/marco you \"want (John Gruber)\":https://alpha.app.net/gruber to \"follow (Garrett Murray)\":https://alpha.app.net/garrettmurray and subscribe in your Google Reader account. Basically you end up with a nice timeline of posts. Make sure you add all the feeds in one folder, you don't want the gibberish talk to mess with your tech blogs subscriptions.\r\n\r\n??After all that being said, he thinks that people who proclaimed RSS dead were pretty much wrong.??"

  Title: "Design the Flying Car"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I could be a high school math teacher, I could be working for Intel, I could be doing research on electronic components and so on… but life made me chose a different path long time a ago.\r\n\r\nWhy did I choose design? Because design is physics, design is math, design means focusing on the important features and scrapping the unimportant details. Design is underrated today. Design is not art, not only art, design means everything and everything means design. You can't retire from designing, there will always be something to be designed (perfected).\r\n\r\nDesign is pure intellectual joy. It means to create, yet it means to engineer. Design is made out of equations that balance the forms and the functions of objects, environments and everything in between those two.\r\n\r\nI want in my life time (flying) levitating cars to become a reality. I know it's possible. I know that it's hard to get to even create a demo of a car powered by wireless current levitating on a magnetic field. Imagine clean streets, no air pollution, no sound pollution, no wheels, cars levitating twenty inches above the surface of Earth. Ten feet above, another car levitating and driving at insane speed without causing accidents. Twenty feet above, another car and so on.\r\n\r\nThe needed \"technology (Quantum Levitation)\":http://www.quantumlevitation.com/ to make levitating cars possible is \"available today (Magnetic Levitation)\":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_levitation, yet no one is focusing on this. All the today corporations are thinking how to make quick money — advertising, constructions, phones, tablets, you name it. Nobody is thinking about the future because nobody is getting money from the future. The world needs real designers, a modern day Leonardo da Vinci."

  Title: "Learn HTML and CSS Easily"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "I often see \"articles (Getting Started with Web Design)\":http://jasonvanlue.com/notes/13737881/getting-started-with-web-design where the author recommends to read a few—not very small—books even for something easy as learning HTML and CSS.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to learn by shipping, a point taken from the recent blog of \"Steven Sinofsky (Learning By Shipping)\":http://blog.learningbyshipping.com/. I want to take the challenge one step further and say that you can _shipping by learning_. Get the right tools that are used by professionals and then start delivering hand made, high quality code without learning anything before that. It seems impossible, but it's not. It's actually how a child starts to walk, they don't learn how to walk, they just do it, over and over again, until it gets perfect. If you learnt about the tag “p” then go ahead and make something useful with that, like creating a few paragraphs inside an HTML document.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to use Firefox and Firebug, because they are the most verbose, easy to learn developer tools available and also, used by professionals. But keep in mind that \"View Source\" might be the first step to get yourself familiarized with tags inside of the HTML documents and #IDs or .classes for styling those tags with CSS."

  Title: "What Our Kids Will Think About Us?"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "We say stupid things on Twitter, we post almost naked pictures on Instagram, we do the same thing on Facebook, but when we are actually drunk. The worst of all these things get shared on Tumblr. Everything is broadcasted live 24/7.\r\n\r\nDo we want to stop? No way! We actually praise Google for giving us Glass so we can continue to do everything I mentioned above even more easily. Who cares about the next generation? How would they get used to all of this nonsense, how would they even manage it? Do we really think Mark cares about his children or the world in which his children will live?\r\n\r\nThe web is a social network because everything that makes it was created by individuals. Does the web needs some lame social networks? Apps created especially for those networks? The answer is no. What the web needs is careful curated content that the next generation will find useful and valuable… and apps that can manage all of this content. Our kids can use the tools we create today to build a future we can only dream of.\r\n\r\n??This article was written on an iPhone 4S using Squarespace Note and published on the web using Textpattern.??"

  Title: "The Future Of RSS Is Microdata"
  Title_html: ""
  Body: "Thanks to Google the web is free again. Reader wasn't quite friendly towards web standards. It wasn't that the Reader acted like a prison for RSS, it was the fact that it felt more like an hospice. It kept us sane every morning, but at the end of the day we worshiped a service that wasn't open. Now it is gone and web is free again. One day I want to say the same thing about social networks.\r\n\r\nh4. Promote your content, not a RSS feed\r\n\r\nThe preference for my own site is to remove any links for RSS, but unfortunately I use Textpattern which provides RSS as a core asset. So, I'll keep it for browsers and apps that can auto-detect the feed with no relevant place in the design of site's layout. I have to keep in mind that this site was designed for the year 2022. It may sound ridiculous at first, but when I posted it on \"Dribbble\":http://dribbble.com/shots/731291-Project-2022 I explained the design principles behind it.\r\n\r\nRecently I added an access count to the site, this way it's making each article standing on its own. The initial page views numbers where gathered from Google Analytics. I don't believe in social networks counters (likes, tweets, plus ones) because they don't change the way an article is consumed, actually they make it worst.\r\n\r\nh4. Microdata saves the day\r\n\r\nMicrodata is an invisible interface added to the HTML code. It can provide the basic feed functionality using descriptors for different parts of content and can be extended using schemas. For example, the first paragraph from my \"About\" page contains the name and a small description of me. This \"thing\" is called a \"Person\":http://schema.org/Person. The Person can have multiple properties which can be defined within inline HTML elements like _span_, _b_ or _i_.\r\n\r\nLet's say I want my readers to know how many times an article was read. Can I past this information to a RSS reader? No, not with a twenty years old format that can't be extended in any way. All I have to do with Microdata is to define the access counter as \"UserPageVisits\":http://schema.org/UserPageVisits and past this information as an \"interactionCount\":http://schema.org/UserInteraction. Now any robot that will parse the page will interpret the data as any human will do. Clever, isn't it?"
