        Before I begin, I want to say that writing isn’t a easy task for me. I’m not a native speaker of English and I mostly feel embarrassed every time I think I do a mistake. This happens probably because being a designer, I’m also a perfectionist. Sometimes perfection gets in the way of doing things. So, this piece of text is about how can I solve the perfectionist writing complex.
