    <p>Lira Media is an unique concept of email marketing. Designed not only to delight the receiver of promotions, but also the marketer. Lira Media is based on top of Lira Suite applications, of which Analytics and Delivery are two of them.</p>
    <p>The main responsibilities for the project were: design direction, interface, workflows, implementation of the layout using latest web technologies. The responsive design was created for a few Django powered web apps.</p>
