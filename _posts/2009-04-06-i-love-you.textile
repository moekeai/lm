I wanted to make a stop motion movie, but ended up with over 2 minutes of footage filmed on May 11, 2007. Last Sunday I discovered it on a tape. Thinking that I can do something with it, I speed it up 4 times and correct the colors in iMovie '09. All the zooming/blurring effects that you'll see are made with camera itself. Now I will let you enjoy this short clip:

<video width="500" height="375" poster="/assets/video/i-love-you.jpg" preload controls>
  <source src="/assets/video/i-love-you.m4v" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="/assets/video/i-love-you.webm" type="video/webm" />
  <source src="/assets/video/i-love-you.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

I also want to mention that the clip was on <a href="http://www.kontain.com/lucianmarin/" rel="nofollow">Kontain</a> front page for a day and received lots of views. You can <a href="/assets/video/i-love-you.m4v" rel="nofollow">download</a> the movie clip or watch it on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kalphegor/3394501047/" rel="nofollow">Flickr</a> instead.

??After all that being said, he will try to say the right things at the right time in the -past- future.??
