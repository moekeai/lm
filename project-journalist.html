        <p>After you download the themes, you'll need to extract them to your <em>/wp-content/themes/</em> directory. Then log into WP and activate the theme from within your presentation panel.</p>

        <p>The themes are licensed under a GPL license. Basically, this means that you're free to do what you like with them as long as you redistribute them under the same license. I do have a small request: If you do use one of the theme, could you send <a href="http://lucianmarin.com/" class="follow">a link back this way</a>? Of course, there is no obligation to do this other than professional courtesy but I would definitely appreciate the gesture. :-)</p>

        <p>The themes will always stay free, but donations are very much appreciated and will help continuing WordPress themes development and to provide support &mdash; <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YSKP3VFTQS4YL" rel="nofollow">donate via PayPal</a>. I like to design themes, but it isn't an easy job as it seems.</p>
