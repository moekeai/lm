notextile. <p itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">Hello, I'm <span itemprop="name">Lucian Marin</span>. <span itemprop="description">I have a background in electronics engineering and currently doing what I love, designing awesome user experiences. I strongly think that design is all about making impossible possible. I dare to like meticulous design, modern typography, lots of genres of electronic music and everything in between.</span></p>

I created a very popular WordPress theme named "The Journalist":http://www.google.com/search?q=journalist+theme, I was interviewed by the Romanian version of The Setup which is called "digerati":http://digerati.ro/lucian-marin, I was featured on "the official Google blog":http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/googles-new-favicon.html for my work on their favicon, I have been part of team who wrote the "Newscoop 3 Cookbook":http://lucianmarin.com/archive/i-wrote-a-book, I have been published in "the Icon Handbook":http://lucianmarin.com/archive/an-iconic-book and I probably did other cool stuff that you may never hear about.

I'm a proud owner of a MacBook Pro 3,1 (summer 2007) which helps me building and designing great user experiences. I shot with a "Nikon P300":http://lucianmarin.tumblr.com/ and I listen to music on an iPod classic. I almost forgot about the "Odin's Rage":http://lucianmarin.com/archive/odins-rage watch.

h4. About this site

The site is created using HMTL 5 and latest CSS innovations. It is based on Textpatten and hosted by "ROHOST":http://rohost.com/ — probably the best hosting provider from Romania. I'm using "Lato font family":http://www.latofonts.com/ for the typographic necessities of this site.

Some things on the site are written in 日本語 because I’m a fan of Japanese culture and art. I don’t know the language, but I want to learn it when I'll get the chance.
