    <p>After you download the theme, all you need to do is <em>jekyll serve -w</em> in terminal. Then open your favorite text editor and edit <em>_config.yml</em> with your details. The three posts that come with the theme can be edited or new ones can be added using the same structure.</p>

    <p>The theme is licensed under the MIT license. Basically, you can do the same things with the theme as with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, since both have the same license. I do have a small request: If you do use the theme, could you send <a href="http://lucianmarin.com/">a link back this way</a>? Of course, there is no obligation to do this other than professional courtesy but I would definitely appreciate the gesture. :-)</p>

    <p>The theme will always stay free, but donations are very much appreciated and will help continuing the development and to provide support &mdash; <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=GNKAMFKW5MMAW" rel="nofollow">donate via PayPal</a>.</p>
