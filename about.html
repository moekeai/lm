        Hi there. I'm Lucian Marin.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a background in electronics engineering and currently doing what I love, designing and building amazing products. I dare to like meticulous design, modern typography, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://soundcloud.com/lucianmarin/likes">electronic music</a> and everything in between. I strongly think that design is all about making impossible <em>possible</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I designed and build <a href="/journalist/">The Journalist</a> &mdash; a very popular WordPress theme, I was interviewed by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://digerati.ro/lucian-marin">Digerati</a> &mdash; the Romanian version of <em>The Setup</em>, I was featured on the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/googles-new-favicon.html">official Google blog</a> for my work on their favicon, I have been part of team who wrote the <a href="/archive/i-wrote-a-book.html">Newscoop 3 Cookbook</a>, I have been interviewed and published in the <a href="/archive/an-iconic-book.html">Icon Handbook</a> about a peculiar project and probably did some other cool stuff that you may never hear about.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2013 I started working on <a href="http://markdawn.com/">Markdawn</a> and I'm still trying to figure out how to do publishing right. In 2014 I built <a href="http://sublevel.net/">Sublevel</a>, a beautiful engineered network and <a href="/monochrome/">Monochrome</a>, a beautiful engineered browser.
    <h4>About the site</h4>
    <p>
        The site is created using the latest web innovations then statically generated with Jekyll and Sass. It is hosted by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://rohost.com/">Rohost</a> &mdash; probably the best hosting provider from Romania.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some things are written in 日本語 because I'm a fan of Japanese culture and art. I don't know the language, but I hope I get the chance to learn it one day.
