!/images/16.jpg(Red Light)!

In the picture above you can see what we call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_to_the_Heroes_of_the_Air" rel="nofollow">Romanian Airmen Heroes Memorial</a>, located in the Aviators' Square, on Aviatorsâ€™ Boulevard, Bucharest.

This photograph should have been posted five days ago, but somehow I manage to forgot about this draft. Yes, I started writing a new draft for my birthday which, guess what, was also postponed. Now let me explain. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Union_Day" rel="nofollow">Great Union Day</a> is the national holiday of Romania and it's celebrated on December 1st. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kalphegor/5207162021/" rel="nofollow">My birthday</a> was five days before this event, enough time to lose track of the things I have to do and care about.
