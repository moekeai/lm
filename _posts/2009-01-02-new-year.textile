There are some types of blog posts that fills your inner ego, like linking to your Google search or like those reviews of the year before and the year ahead. Some people goes after all the little details, complete new year resolutions. Mine is quite simple. 2008 was "my year":http://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+journalist+by+lucian+e.+marin%22. No, it wasn't. 2009 will be "that year":http://www.google.com/search?q=lucian+e.+marin. Actually, who knows what will happen?

??After all that being said, he will do his best to keep it -simple- real from now on.??
