Sometimes you just have to have the ball in order to play. Can I have "some ball":http://dribbble.com/, please? Or should I go all over the -place- web for "a slam dunk":http://www.pleaseinvitemetodribbble.com/?

*Edit* (Feb 20, 2011): I got "a prospect account":http://dribbble.com/lucianmarin. Is there anyone willing to draft me?

*Edit* (Dec 22, 2011): Finally, one year and a half later I got an invite from "Artem Lapitski":http://www.artemlapitski.com/. Never say never.
