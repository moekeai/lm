        <p><a href="http://lucianmarin.com/peculiar/">Peculiar</a> is a free icon package made only in CSS. It was created for sites and web applications that depend on fewer HTTP requests as possible or don't need to use any image at all. The package contains 45 pictograms that are available in 16&sup2; pixels size. More icons are about to come in the future.</p>

        <p>Endless possibilities are coming with these type of icons. Sizes are not limited to 16&sup2; pixels, but they go up to 1024&sup2; pixels and from there to &infin;.

Web designers can now use these icons to create layouts skipping the Photoshop in the process and web developers can speed up their web applications tremendously.</p>

        <p>Peculiar is <a href="retina-ready.png">Retina-ready</a> by design, meaning that the same code is used for both regular and Retina displays. If you want to develop web apps for iPhone 4S and iPad 3, this icon set will be your friend.</p>
